<h2 id="intro"> MY INTRO </h2> 
Good mrng sir,
	Myself Kodi Bharadwaj. Iam Currently persuing my 
undergraduate program in electrical and electronics domain
in NIT Calicut.Iam from srikakulam, Andhra pradesh.
Coming to my academics, I got 100 percentage in bse and 98 
percentage in bie. 

Coming to my technical skills, Iam comfortable with c++,c,data structures in programming 
also html, css, java script, and react in web development part.

coming to my hobbies,,,, i love enjoying new things which
inspire me.I would like to grow both personally as well as professionally.

I have done projects on web page development. One is 

1) a mern messenger which is a chatting application 
in which user is securely allowed into the app and can make real time chat
and this was deployed in render to make it available online.
and another one is the sudoku game solver.

In which user is able to solve puzzles and can receive the instant solutions
of it by the c++ code in the script.js file and this is deployed in github.

I have also created my portfolio using HTML and CSS in a responsive way
in which all my skill set and links of all my achivements are included which is
deployed in render.
















Concepts to study:
<h2 id="java_script">Java script:</h2>
Popular web language which is free to use.
Javascript is executed on the client-side as well as server-side also.
It uses Ecma script 6(version of js) which includes features: let,const,arrow fn,map,js modules(import like that) etc.

1) what are the data types of js?
	a)primitive: string,var,boolean
	b)Non-primitive: used to store multiple values like a collection.

2)what is hoisting in js?
	ariable and function declarations are moved on top.
	ex: a = 3;
	    console.log(a);
	    var a;

3. Why do we use the word “debugger” in javascript?
	The debugger for the browser must be activated in order to debug the code.While debugging, the next code line wont 
	gets executed.

4. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
	== focus on the values and === focus on the type
	ex: var x = 2;
	    var y = "2";
	    (x == y)  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
	    (x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"

5. Difference between var and let keyword in javascript.

	var: it is acceptable anywhere in the function and can be modified
	let: limited to the block of code where it is declared and cant be modified once the value is assigned.

6.Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
	when two variables are of different types then concatenation gets occur
	ex: var x = 3;
   	    var y = "3";
	    x + y // Returns "33" 

7. Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?
	it is dynamically typed language because the values assigned to the values are checked at run-time rather than 
	compile-time.

8. What is NaN property in JavaScript?
	NaN stands for Not a Number
	ex: 
	isNaN("Hello")  // Returns true
	isNaN(345)   // Returns false
	isNaN('1')  // Returns false, since '1' is converted to Number type which results in 0 ( a number) 
	isNaN(true) // Returns false, since true converted to Number type results in 1 ( a number)
	isNaN(false) // Returns false
	isNaN(undefined) // Returns true

9. Explain passed by value and passed by reference.
	In JavaScript, primitive data types are passed by value and non-primitive data types are passed by reference.
	ex:
	Primitive: var a = 5;
	Non-primitive: var obj = { name: "Vivek", surname: "Bisht" };
		       var obj2 = obj; // here the reference of obj is passed to obj2.

10. What is an Immediately Invoked Function in JavaScript?
	An Immediately Invoked Function known as IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.

	ex:
	// Regular Function.   
	function hello()   
	{   
    	   console.log("Regular function");   
	};   
	// Regular Function execution.   
	hello();   
    
	// IIFE creation and execution.   
	(function() { console.log("Immediately Invoked Function Expression"); })();
  
11. What do you mean by strict mode in javascript and characteristics of javascript strict-mode?
	In java script strict mode, errors cant be raised because of these characteristics:
		1.Duplicate arguments are not allowed by developers.
		2.In strict mode, not able to use the JavaScript keyword as a parameter or function name.
		3.strict keyword is defined at the start of the script. 
		4.Not able to create global variables in strict mode.

12. Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript.
	Defining function inside a function.

13. Explain “this” keyword.
	this keyword refers to an object(collection of properties).

14. What do you mean by Self Invoking Functions?
	function gets executed without calling it.	
	An anonymous function is enclosed inside a set of parentheses followed by another set of parentheses (),
	which does the execution.

	(function(){
    	console.log("This function is called immediately");
	})();

15. Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods.
	call():a method to call a function in which we can pass the other function's parameters.
const person = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
const person1 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe"
}
const person2 = {
  firstName:"Mary",
  lastName: "Doe"
}

// This will return "John Doe":
person.fullName.call(person1);

	apply():The apply method is similar to the call() method. The only difference is that, call() method takes arguments 
	separately whereas, apply() method takes arguments as an array.
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const numbers = [5, 7];
const result = addNumbers.apply(null, numbers);
console.log(result); // Output: 12
	
	blind(): This method returns a new function, where the value of “this” keyword will be bound to the owner object, 
        which is provided as a parameter.

16. What is the difference between exec() and test() methods in javascript?
	exec(): is used to search a string. if(found) it prints the pattern of string else prints 'empty'.
	test(): is used to find a requiered part in a string. if(found) prints true else false.

17.What is currying in JavaScript?
	Currying is an advanced technique to transform a function of arguments n, to n functions of one or fewer arguments.
	ex:
function add (a) {
  return function(b){
    return a + b;
  }
}

add(3)(4) 

18. What are callbacks?
	a function is called with having some parameters in it along with another function name.
	ex:here after performing operatioOnSum function, divideByHalf function is called since it is used as callback.
function divideByHalf(sum){
  console.log(Math.floor(sum / 2));
}

function multiplyBy2(sum){
  console.log(sum * 2);
}

function operationOnSum(num1,num2,operation){
  var sum = num1 + num2;
  operation(sum);
}

operationOnSum(3, 3, divideByHalf); // Outputs 3

operationOnSum(5, 5, multiplyBy2); // Outputs 20

19.What are the errors in js?
	syntax errors(parsing) and Logical errors.

20.What is DOM?
	DOM is Document Object Model. It is a programming interface of HTML and XML documents.When the browser tries 
	to render an HTML document, it creates an object based on the HTML document called DOM. 
	Using this DOM, we can manipulate or change various elements inside the HTML document.

21) what are the two types of functions in js?
	a) Named functions:  These type of functions contains name at the time of definition. For Example:
function display()  
{  
  document.writeln("Named Function");  
}  
display();  

	b) Anonymous functions:These type of functions doesn't contain any name. They are declared dynamically at runtime.
var display=function()  
{  
  document.writeln("Anonymous Function");  
}  
display();  

22) Are Java and JavaScript same?
	No, Java and JavaScript are the two different languages. Java is a robust, secured and object-oriented 
	programming language whereas JavaScript is a client-side scripting language with some limitations.

23) How to handle exceptions in JavaScript?
	By the help of try/catch block, we can handle exceptions in JavaScript. 
	JavaScript supports try, catch, finally and throw keywords for exception handling.


Disadvantages:
No support for multithreading.
No support for multiprocessing.
Reading and writing of files is not allowed.


concentrate on js closures, bom

<h2 id="react">REACT JS:</h2>
React:
It is a frontend java script library used to build user interfaces created by facebook.
Code reusability.
It uses virtual dom(Instead of reloading the entire page, it gets changed at the specifice part of only where the change is
happened. 
We need npm to start react. React ES6 features are: classes, arrow fn's, destructuring, spread operator, ternary etc.
How to render?
	const container = document.getElementById('root');
	const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
	root.render(<p>Hello</p>);
JSX stands for Java Script XML (JSX allows us to write HTML code inside JavaScript)


Advantages:
Supports server side rendering.
Makes virtual dom rather than real dom.
Code reusability.
SEO friendly.

Limitations:
It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.


1. what are props?
	Props are nothing but properties(html attributes) which are send to the class components.(typically from parent
	component to child component)
2. What is React Hooks?
	These are builtin functions which are the features from functional component.
	These should be implemented at the top in the functional component and should not be conditional.
3. Explain useState() react hook.
	It is used to maintain a state value. The value is monitored and its get updated when changes happen.
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}


4.Explain useEffect hook.
	Used to perform the side effects in functional components.It gets run after there is a change in the state of our
	application.

5.why react not angular?
	In angular there is no virtual dom, slow, angular is client side only. Angular is by Google.

6.How React's ES6 syntax is different from ES5 syntax? 
	var React = require('react');  
	module.exports = Component;  // ES5

	import React from 'react';
	export default Component;   // ES6

7. What are the problems in real DOM than Virtual DOM?
	1.real dom manipulation is expensive
	2.lot of memory wastage.
	3.updates slower.



concentrate on Hooks,keys,props
