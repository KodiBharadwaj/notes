Coming to my academics, I got 100 percentage in bse and 98 
percentage in bie. 

Coming to my technical skills, Iam comfortable with c++,c,data structures in programming 
also html, css, java script, and react in web development part.

coming to my hobbies,,,, i love enjoying new things which
inspire me.I would like to grow both personally as well as professionally.

I have done projects on web page development. One is 

1) a mern messenger which is a chatting application 
in which user is securely allowed into the app and can make real time chat
and this was deployed in render to make it available online.
and another one is the sudoku game solver.

In which user is able to solve puzzles and can receive the instant solutions
of it by the c++ code in the script.js file and this is deployed in github.

I have also created my portfolio using HTML and CSS in a responsive way

deployed in render.












Myself Kodi Bharadwaj. Iam currently persuing my undergraduate program in Electrical and Electronics domain in Nit Calicut.
Iam from srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh. Coming to my academics, I got 100 percentage in bse and 97 percentage in bie education.
Coming to my technical skills, Iam comfortable with c++, c, data structures and algorithms in programming and html, css, js
and react in web development part. Iam good in understanding the basics of power electronics and matlab simulink. Coming to 
hobbies, I love enjoying new things which will inspire me and I Would like to grow personally as well as professionally. 
Coming to my projects, I have done a project on Designing battery and supercapacitor hybrid energy system in which battery 
and solar panel supplies the power according to the load demand. Supercapacitor comes into the picture when there is an 
instantaneous power is required by the load in order to increase the lifespan of the battery. So, the main motto is of this 
project is to increase the lifespan of the battery with the help of control logic and supercapacitor. 
Another project is buck converter circuit design, in which we are going to step down the input voltage to some required low
voltage with the help of an inductor, capacitor, a diode. To generate sufficient pulse, 555 timer is designed and connected
to the gate terminal of the mosfet. 
Coming to my coding projects, I have done a mern messenger which is typically a web chatting application in which user is 
securely authenticated into the app and can make a real time chat. In order to make it available online, I have deployed it
in render portal. 
Another one is the sudoku solver in which users can play sudoku puzzles and can get instant solution of it by the recursive
code inserted in the javascript file. This was pushed and deployed in the github. I have also made my portfolio using html 
and css in a responsive way in which all my skillset and achievements are included. Thank you.









MY Projects:
1)Buck coverter design:
	Conversion of high voltage to low voltage dc using
buck circuit design.It operates on switching mode for that 
555 timer ciruit is designed seperately to produde the 
required pulse width which is connected to mosfet switch.
Now further inductor and capacitor is connected to complete 
its design.
for the given input and output voltage i have calculated the
required pulse width and got this at 555 timer.Hence the 
required 5v came at the output side.

diode-1N4007
mosfet-IRF640(N-channel mosfet)- metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor
insted of mosfet we can use bjt- bipolar junction transistor


2)dc motor interfacing using pic18f4550:
	controlling speed and its direction usng chip
pic18f4550. First the chip was loaded with the required 
code using mplab software and then hardware components 
are connected. DC motor direction is controlled by a 
motor driver l293d which works on inbuilt h bridge 
principle.

pic18f4550:8bit risc architecture,low power consumption,
applications: controlling motors, usb based,electronics,remote censor devices etc.
disadvantages: ltd processing power, ltd memory
motor driver L293D:inbuilt h bridge principle.







	












Concepts to study:
<h2 id="java_script">Java script:</h2>
Popular web language which is free to use.
Javascript is executed on the client-side as well as server-side also.
It uses Ecma script 6(version of js) which includes features: let,const,arrow fn,map,js modules(import like that) etc.

1) what are the data types of js?
	a)primitive: string,var,boolean
	b)Non-primitive: used to store multiple values like a collection.

2)what is hoisting in js?
	ariable and function declarations are moved on top.
	ex: a = 3;
	    console.log(a);
	    var a;

3. Why do we use the word “debugger” in javascript?
	The debugger for the browser must be activated in order to debug the code.While debugging, the next code line wont 
	gets executed.

4. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
	== focus on the values and === focus on the type
	ex: var x = 2;
	    var y = "2";
	    (x == y)  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
	    (x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"

5. Difference between var and let keyword in javascript.

	var: it is acceptable anywhere in the function and can be modified
	let: limited to the block of code where it is declared and cant be modified once the value is assigned.

6.Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
	when two variables are of different types then concatenation gets occur
	ex: var x = 3;
   	    var y = "3";
	    x + y // Returns "33" 

7. Is javascript a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?
	it is dynamically typed language because the values assigned to the values are checked at run-time rather than 
	compile-time.

8. What is NaN property in JavaScript?
	NaN stands for Not a Number
	ex: 
	isNaN("Hello")  // Returns true
	isNaN(345)   // Returns false
	isNaN('1')  // Returns false, since '1' is converted to Number type which results in 0 ( a number) 
	isNaN(true) // Returns false, since true converted to Number type results in 1 ( a number)
	isNaN(false) // Returns false
	isNaN(undefined) // Returns true

9. Explain passed by value and passed by reference.
	In JavaScript, primitive data types are passed by value and non-primitive data types are passed by reference.
	ex:
	Primitive: var a = 5;
	Non-primitive: var obj = { name: "Vivek", surname: "Bisht" };
		       var obj2 = obj; // here the reference of obj is passed to obj2.

10. What is an Immediately Invoked Function in JavaScript?
	An Immediately Invoked Function known as IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.

	ex:
	// Regular Function.   
	function hello()   
	{   
    	   console.log("Regular function");   
	};   
	// Regular Function execution.   
	hello();   
    
	// IIFE creation and execution.   
	(function() { console.log("Immediately Invoked Function Expression"); })();
  
11. What do you mean by strict mode in javascript and characteristics of javascript strict-mode?
	In java script strict mode, errors cant be raised because of these characteristics:
		1.Duplicate arguments are not allowed by developers.
		2.In strict mode, not able to use the JavaScript keyword as a parameter or function name.
		3.strict keyword is defined at the start of the script. 
		4.Not able to create global variables in strict mode.

12. Explain Higher Order Functions in javascript.
	Defining function inside a function.

13. Explain “this” keyword.
	this keyword refers to an object(collection of properties).

14. What do you mean by Self Invoking Functions?
	function gets executed without calling it.	
	An anonymous function is enclosed inside a set of parentheses followed by another set of parentheses (),
	which does the execution.

	(function(){
    	console.log("This function is called immediately");
	})();

15. Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods.
	call():a method to call a function in which we can pass the other function's parameters.
const person = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
const person1 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe"
}
const person2 = {
  firstName:"Mary",
  lastName: "Doe"
}

// This will return "John Doe":
person.fullName.call(person1);

	apply():The apply method is similar to the call() method. The only difference is that, call() method takes arguments 
	separately whereas, apply() method takes arguments as an array.
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const numbers = [5, 7];
const result = addNumbers.apply(null, numbers);
console.log(result); // Output: 12
	
	blind(): This method returns a new function, where the value of “this” keyword will be bound to the owner object, 
        which is provided as a parameter.

16. What is the difference between exec() and test() methods in javascript?
	exec(): is used to search a string. if(found) it prints the pattern of string else prints 'empty'.
	test(): is used to find a requiered part in a string. if(found) prints true else false.

17.What is currying in JavaScript?
	Currying is an advanced technique to transform a function of arguments n, to n functions of one or fewer arguments.
	ex:
function add (a) {
  return function(b){
    return a + b;
  }
}

add(3)(4) 

18. What are callbacks?
	a function is called with having some parameters in it along with another function name.
	ex:here after performing operatioOnSum function, divideByHalf function is called since it is used as callback.
function divideByHalf(sum){
  console.log(Math.floor(sum / 2));
}

function multiplyBy2(sum){
  console.log(sum * 2);
}

function operationOnSum(num1,num2,operation){
  var sum = num1 + num2;
  operation(sum);
}

operationOnSum(3, 3, divideByHalf); // Outputs 3

operationOnSum(5, 5, multiplyBy2); // Outputs 20

19.What are the errors in js?
	syntax errors(parsing) and Logical errors.

20.What is DOM?
	DOM is Document Object Model. It is a programming interface of HTML and XML documents.When the browser tries 
	to render an HTML document, it creates an object based on the HTML document called DOM. 
	Using this DOM, we can manipulate or change various elements inside the HTML document.

21) what are the two types of functions in js?
	a) Named functions:  These type of functions contains name at the time of definition. For Example:
function display()  
{  
  document.writeln("Named Function");  
}  
display();  

	b) Anonymous functions:These type of functions doesn't contain any name. They are declared dynamically at runtime.
var display=function()  
{  
  document.writeln("Anonymous Function");  
}  
display();  

22) Are Java and JavaScript same?
	No, Java and JavaScript are the two different languages. Java is a robust, secured and object-oriented 
	programming language whereas JavaScript is a client-side scripting language with some limitations.

23) How to handle exceptions in JavaScript?
	By the help of try/catch block, we can handle exceptions in JavaScript. 
	JavaScript supports try, catch, finally and throw keywords for exception handling.


Disadvantages:
No support for multithreading.
No support for multiprocessing.
Reading and writing of files is not allowed.


concentrate on js closures, bom

<h2 id="react">REACT JS:</h2>
React:
It is a frontend java script library used to build user interfaces created by facebook.
Code reusability.
It uses virtual dom(Instead of reloading the entire page, it gets changed at the specifice part of only where the change is
happened. 
We need npm to start react. React ES6 features are: classes, arrow fn's, destructuring, spread operator, ternary etc.
How to render?
	const container = document.getElementById('root');
	const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
	root.render(<p>Hello</p>);
JSX stands for Java Script XML (JSX allows us to write HTML code inside JavaScript)


Advantages:
Supports server side rendering.
Makes virtual dom rather than real dom.
Code reusability.
SEO friendly.

Limitations:
It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.


1. what are props?
	Props are nothing but properties(html attributes) which are send to the class components.(typically from parent
	component to child component)
2. What is React Hooks?
	These are builtin functions which are the features from functional component.
	These should be implemented at the top in the functional component and should not be conditional.
3. Explain useState() react hook.
	It is used to maintain a state value. The value is monitored and its get updated when changes happen.
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}


4.Explain useEffect hook.
	Used to perform the side effects in functional components.It gets run after there is a change in the state of our
	application.

5.why react not angular?
	In angular there is no virtual dom, slow, angular is client side only. Angular is by Google.

6.How React's ES6 syntax is different from ES5 syntax? 
	var React = require('react');  
	module.exports = Component;  // ES5

	import React from 'react';
	export default Component;   // ES6

7. What are the problems in real DOM than Virtual DOM?
	1.real dom manipulation is expensive
	2.lot of memory wastage.
	3.updates slower.



concentrate on Hooks,keys,props

<h2 id="computing"> Computer networks basics </h2> 
1) What is DNS(Domain Name System)
	
Certainly! Let's break down DNS in simpler terms:

<b>Naming Websites: </b>
Think of the internet like a huge city with many houses. Each house needs a unique address for people to find it. 
Similarly, websites on the internet have unique addresses called IP addresses (like phone numbers for computers).
	
<b>Domain Names:</b>
Instead of remembering complex IP addresses, we use domain names (e.g., www.example.com). It's like using names instead 
of phone numbers to contact friends.
	
<b>DNS is Like a Phonebook:</b>
DNS is like a giant phonebook for the internet. When you type a domain name in your browser, DNS helps find the correct
IP address associated with that name.
	
<b>How It Works:</b>
Imagine you want to visit a website (e.g., www.example.com). Your computer asks a DNS system, "Hey, what's the IP address for www.example.com?"
The DNS system checks its records and says, "It's this IP address: 192.168.1.1."
Now, your computer knows where to find the website, just like knowing a friend's address.

<b>DNS Servers:</b>
DNS servers are like friendly librarians who help you find information. Some are big librarians (like Google's DNS), 
and some are local librarians (your ISP's DNS). 
	
<b>Caching:</b>
To make things faster, your computer remembers (caches) the IP addresses it gets from DNS. If you visit the same website again, 
your computer already knows the address.
	
<b>Hierarchy: </b>

DNS is organized like a big tree. At the top are the root servers, then domain registrars (like city planners), 
and finally, individual websites (like houses).
In summary, DNS is like an internet address book. It helps your computer find the right address (IP) for websites you want to visit, 
making the internet more user-friendly.

<br> <br> <br> <br>

2) What is a firewall?
Imagine a Security Guard for Your Computer:

A firewall is like a security guard for your computer or network. It watches over the traffic coming in and going out, 
deciding what is safe and what is not. 

<b>Building a Barrier:</b>
Think of your computer or network as a castle. The firewall builds a protective barrier around it to keep bad things out.
	
<b>Checking Every Visitor:</b>
When data (like messages or files) wants to enter or leave your castle (computer), the firewall checks it. 
It asks, "Are you safe? Do I know you?" If the answer is yes, it allows the data through. If not, it blocks it.
		
<b>Guarding Against Bad Stuff:</b>
Sometimes, there are bad things on the internet (like viruses or hackers). The firewall is like a superhero guard, 
protecting your computer from these bad things.
	
<b>Keeping Records:</b>
The firewall keeps a record of everything that happens. It's like a security log that helps figure out what went wrong if there's ever a problem.
In simple terms, a firewall is like a digital security guard that watches over your computer, checks who is coming and going, and ensures that only 
the good stuff gets in while keeping the bad stuff out. It's an essential part of keeping your computer safe on the internet.

    inside the db.




Mern overview:
Its typically a web chatting application in which

-> Two pages are present called home page and chat page. ‌Initially, the execution of code starts at index.js file throught which 
homepage will be rendered in the browser. There user is able to find two components called login and signup.
-> user needs to create an account with his credentials and when he clicks on submit button an api call will be made knowns 
as post request.Mean while when the post request was made it sends a request to the backend and there the user details will
be validated through routing of modules in my project.

->When everything is fine, he will get a toast like user registration successfull and then he is allowed to the chatpage
where we can find side drawer which typically consists search user option, Notification badge, profile menu. and mychats,
and chatbox.

-> in the search bar, user can search for other users where the users will be populated there. so when he clicks on 
the required user, he  can able to make a real time chat with his friends.


Sudoku Project:
->In this the user can able to solve a sudoku puzzle and can get instant solutions for it.
->In html files the div elements are present in the form of 9*9 grids and when the user click on the
get puzzle option an external resource is called and a random 2d arry of 9*9 will be generated at rendered to the 
browser. When the user clicks on Solve puzzle the code which is written in script.js file gets executed and this 
puzzle gets solved using recursion.
